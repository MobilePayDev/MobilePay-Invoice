## Invoice 1.4 Release Notes
 <div class='post-date'> </div>
 
### <a name="response_code"></a> 16 january 2020 - Increased Invoice FI amount
Invoice FI <code>Amount</code> validation was increased to 2000 EUR

### <a name="response_code"></a> 08 november 2019 - Removed consumer name validation
<code>ConsumerName</code> validation (Levenshtein rule) was removed from InvoiceDirect validation rules.
However, it is still used for displaying <code>ConsumerName</code> when generating invoice PDF.


### <a name="response_code"></a> 06 august 2019 - Response Code 
The response codes for invoices have been unified. Batch requests now return <code>202</code> , all others should now return <code>200</code> 
If your system logic examines the concrete response code and checks strict the status code, you may have to change the logic in order to cope with the change in response code. We do not consider this a breaking chance, as most merchants only check if the call was a success such as 2xx, and do not depend on a concrete status code. However, having the right HTTP status codes mapped also enables you to get more insight around the response received.


### <a name="response_code"></a> 01 march 2019 - QR code

New feature: Scanning QR code with InvoiceLink will open MobilePay Invoice

We're excited to announce, that MobilePay's own QR code reader can now read a QR code, that contains InvoiceLink. Read more about InvoiceLink [here](https://github.com/MobilePayDev/MobilePay-Invoice/blob/master/docs/api_reference.md#-invoicelink) 
- When you scan a QR with the MobilePay app, and the QR contains InvoiceLink, then the Invoice context screen is opened.
- If the scanned link is already expired, then the user will see an error message in the overlay screen
- If the invoice is expired, then the endpoint will return a 404 status

### <a name="Merchant-PDF"></a> Provide your own PDF for invoice
Currenlty, PDF file of the invoice is generated internally by MobilePay. With release of **Invoice 1.4** merchants now have a possibility to provide the URL to their own PDF file.

If you create an invoice with <code>InvoiceUrl</code> parameter filled in, user will be redirected to the URL from the app when showing an invoice, otherwise the previous flow of showing PDF generated by MobilePay internally will apply.

The following endpoints will be extended to accept an optional <code>InvoiceUrl</code> parameter:

```
POST api/v1/merchants/{merchantId}/invoices
POST api/v1/merchants/{merchantId}/invoices/batch
POST api/v1/merchants/{merchantId}/invoices/link
POST api/v1/merchants/{merchantId}/invoices/link/batch
```
